Problem 1:

Implement function for sorting linked list in descending order.

Problem 2:

Implement function which will move part of linked list between values val1 and val2 to the end of linked list. 
Pointer Tail (end of linked list) can't be used. Values in list are unique, val1 and val 2 exist in list, and val1 is behind val2.

Problem 3:

Implement function which will find node with value key and move it two nodes forward. If it's not possible to move it forward,
then move it at the begining of list.
